Once or twice in a week we have a class for Library. We used to move Library and we will take any story book or subject related book. And then we will read a book in a class and in next class Library teacher will ask some questions to the students from the book which we have read. Sometimes we take the books, otherwise Library teacher will give the books to us. Usually we all take a dictonary to check the meaning of any words which we don't know. We all love Library.

It is a very good and wonderful idea of my school. It's very important to save water. Rainwater harvesting is the collection and storage of rain, rather than allowing it to run off. Rainwater is collected from a roof-like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit, aquifer, or a reservoir with percolation. Dew and fog can also be collected with nets or other tools. Rainwater harvesting differs from stormwater harvesting as the runoff is collected from roofs, rather than creeks, drains, roads, or any other land surfaces. This is a wonderful idea of my school. I thank my school.
